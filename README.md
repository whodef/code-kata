## [What are Code Katas and Why Should we Care?](https://medium.com/hackernoon/what-are-code-katas-and-why-should-we-care-2e3f1b7e111c)
<q>While we, as software system developers, certainly know that our day to day work can bring a lot of satisfaction and improvement to our profession, there prove to be other ways that we can also try out to flex our coding “muscle”. “Kata” is a term borrowed from the world of martial arts. According to Wikipedia, a kata “is a detailed choreographed pattern of movements made to be practiced alone, but are also practiced within groups and in unison when training.” That sounds a bit different that what you might’ve expected. But if you think about it, our coding craft is not that much different. We practice a pattern of strokes, sometimes alone, but also in groups, you might know as teams, or pairs, that sometimes translate into pair programming sessions.</q>
